### Added
  
- Added support for notification with `@NotificationHandler` attribute
- Added `dispatcher` property of type `IDispatcher` to `mediatorSettings`.
- Added `publish` method to `Mediator`
  
### Changed

- `@Handler` is now deprecated use `@RequestHandler` instead.

### Breaking changes

- The `resolve` method of `IResolver` is changed from `resolve<T>(name: string): IRequestHandler<IRequest<T>, T>;` to `resolve<T>(name: string): T;` this is necessary because the resolver now is used by the request handler and by the dispatcher.
